        THE DAWN OF TIME
      </h2>
      <p>
        Long ago, in a faraway universe, there was nothing but darkness. Godlike
        beings known as the Overseers used their powers to create two worlds and
        six entities to watch over them. The planets, separated by nothing more
        than a thin dimensional barrier, were named <b>Maple World</b> and
        Grandis, and each received three guardians, known as Transcendents, who
        represent the powers of life, light and time. As life-forms began to
        populate these wondrous worlds, a legend spread amongst the people of
        Maple World that their planet was nothing more than a dream of Rhinne,
        the <b style="color: red">Transcendent of Time.</b>

      <h2>THE TRANSCENDENT OF <span style="color: goldenrod">LIGHT</span></h2>
      <p>
        Maple World's Transcendent of Light went unnoticed for years, a mortal
        living among ordinary people. Known as the White Mage, he was a humble
        scientist working with a research group called Aurora. Aurora was intent
        on unlocking the secrets of light, and the <b><i>White Mage</i></b> was
        their star researcher. But he went too far—his experiments extended into
        the dead of night, and he went for weeks without eating or sleeping.
        Something dark was awoken inside of him, sinister magic that poisoned
        the pure light at his core. Though his fellow scientists tried to help,
        their efforts were in vain: The White Mage transformed into the Black
        Mage, a god among men whose very existence threatened to tear Maple
        World apart.

      <h2>THE RISE OF THE BLACK MAGE</h2>
      <p>
        Aurora fought off the Black Mage at a great cost, but the skirmish only
        seemed to make him more powerful. <br /><br />
        His former colleagues defeated, the Black Mage went about recruiting
        commanders to lead his armies:<br /><br />
        <b style="color: gold">Arkarium</b>, a former monk from the Temple of
        Time and the Mage's right hand; <b style="color: gold">Von Leon</b>,
        ruler of a now forgotten kingdom, who is capable of transforming into a
        massive lion; twins<b style="color: gold"> Orchid</b> and
        <b style="color: gold">Lotus</b>, fiends responsible for assassinating
        Aria, the empress of a peaceful realm; the
        <b style="color: gold">Demon Slayer</b>, a half human/half demon hybrid;
        <b style="color: gold">Hilla</b>, a vain beauty who betrayed her city
        for the Mage's promise of immortality;
        <b style="color: gold">Magnus</b>, a disgraced hero of the Nova, the
        native race of the planet <b style="color: gold">Grandis</b>; and
        <b style="color: gold">Guwaru</b>, an elemental spirit of the forest.
        His entourage assembled, the Black Mage proceeded to rob Rhinne of her
        power, and with the help of the Demon Slayer, sealed her in a chaotic
        netherworld. Now infused with the powers of light and time, the Black
        Mage laid waste to the peaceful lands of Maple World. For years, none
        dared defy him... until an alliance was forged.
